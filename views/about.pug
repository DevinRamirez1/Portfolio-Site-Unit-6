        .about-bio

          p I am a bucket full of experience. As an Eagle Scout learning to develop leadership skills and teamwork, to my experience across multiple fields such as retail, cemetery groundskeeper, inspector in oil and gas, and finally a machinist. I have experienced many different problems to solve across all of these fields which gives me exceptional problem solving skills. This is the number one strength of a developer, to plan and problem solve. I have years of experience doing that across many different skills giving me a variety of views to tackle any problems or projects thrown my way.
